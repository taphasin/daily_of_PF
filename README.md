# PROGRAMMING PROJECT 01076104

year 1 - semester 1

This repository keeps my homework on programming fundamental subjects.
Each week, I needed to find a programming question,
then solved it, and explained how the code worked.

Each day folder represents each week.

> this repository was fork from my old github account.
